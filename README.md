Useful, configurable, and fully featured administration stick for DarkRP

**Description:**

This is a fully configurable and featured admin stick for DarkRP and was build upon the original Top Hatted Cat's Administration Stick. It has plenty of features that will help with the administration of a server, make your job a lot easier, and more fun!

**Installation:**

Simply download the zip or clone this repository into your addons folder.

**To do:**

* ~~Make the move entity tool user specific. It currently only supports one entity on the clipboard for the entire server.~~

The config options are explained in admin_stick_config.lua.
Pull requests and feature requests are appreciated!

This was originally intended for use on my own server and I haven't spent the time to reset everything to default and remove any unneccesary features, use at your own risk.
